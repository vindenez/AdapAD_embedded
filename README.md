An implementation of Adaptive Anomaly Detector (AdapAD) for embedded systems with limited computational resources. AdapAD is an AI-based model for automatic data quality control.

The model aims to detect anomalous measurements from real-time univariate time series data.


Make sure makefile suits your CPU architecture. Config path is specified in Main.cpp, other paths/hyperparameters are defined in Config.yaml.

If you use included Makefile:  
Clean - make clean  
Build - make  
Run - ./adapad
