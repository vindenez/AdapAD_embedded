An implementation of Adaptive Anomaly Detector (AdapAD) for embedded systems with limited computational resources. AdapAD is an AI-based model for automatic data quality control.

The model aims to detect anomalous measurements from real-time data, which support data validators and data consumers to assess the quality of data for further usage.


Make sure makefile suits your CPU architecture. Config path is specified in Main.cpp, other paths/hyperparameters are defined in Config.yaml.

"make" for generic build -> "./adapad" to run
